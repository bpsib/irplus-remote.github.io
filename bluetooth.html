    Transmitting IR signals via Bluetooth to be sent by external IR hardware (irplus LAN)
</p>

<p>irplus LAN This is a spin-off app of the original for sending custom infrared codes via a WiFi or Bluetooth. It has all the
    same features, but instead of using the IR-blaster it will send the IR-sequence over network (via plain HTTP) to a server
    which will do the job of processing and sending them as IR-light. Sounds cool? So you can make use of the app even when
    using a phone without IR-blaster. Although there is a small catch. You need to setup a server to process the signal.
    The process will be described here.</p>

<p>Variant 1: For this guide we will use an Arduino Uno with a Bluetooth HC-05 serial module. The infrared LED with a Resistor on it's
    voltage pin will be attached to a PWM pin (3 as default) and GND. For the connection of the HC05 please check the following
    diagram. Note: It could be that you have to use a voltage regulator for the Pin-out! This depends on wether your HC05
    has a voltage regulator integrated on it's breakboard or not! Using the Pin-out (5V) without any voltage regulator will
    most likely fry your HC05! Also Note: rxPin -> TXD, txPin -> RXD! 
</p>
<p>Variant 2: For this guide we will use an ESP32 Module which comes with WiFi and Bluetooth out of the box.

        Instructions for flashing
    </p>
    
    
<p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make sure the components are wired up correctly. <i>Common mistake:</i> You do NOT need to connect VCC of IR Transmitter Boards, only DATA and GND!</li>
    <li>Download the script for your hardware using the table below</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">Download</a> and Install Arduino IDE </li>
    <li>Install IRremote 3.3.0 using Manage Libraries (Ctrl+Shift+I)</li>
    <li>For ESP32 you need to add https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json in Preferences and in Board Manager you'llneed to install esp32 and select "Board: ESP32 Dev Module". Make sure you're using the correct COM Port. On Windows to flash you need to keep BOOT pressed.</li>
    <li>Open the Script with Arduino IDE and make sure it compiles (Ctrl+R) and after verifying do upload (Ctrl+U). After rebooting the device should be pairable in Android.</li>
    <li>Pair your Android with the Bluetooth module (Password: 1234). The name could vary. For ESP32 it is "irplusESP32"</li>
    <li>Now start/restart irplusLAN and select the <b>already paired</b> Bluetooth module in the App's settings.</li>
    <li>If you press a button on irplusLAN the app will transmit the signal to Arduino via Bluetooth and Arduino will send
      the IR signal.</li>
    <li>To verify you can as usual use a different phone's camera to see the IR light. Some IR Emitter Breadboards come with an LED light to show activity</li>
  </ol>
