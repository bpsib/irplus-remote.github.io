    Transmitting IR signals via WiFi (HTTP) to external IR hardware (irplus LAN)
</p>

<p>irplus LAN This is a spin-off app of the original for sending custom infrared codes via a WiFi or Bluetooth. It has all the
    same features, but instead of using the IR-blaster it will send the IR-sequence over network (via plain HTTP) to a server
    which will do the job of processing and sending them as IR-light. Sounds cool? So you can make use of the app even when
    using a phone without IR-blaster. Although there is a small catch. You need to setup a server to process the signal.
    The process will be described here.</p>

    Prepare the hardware
</p>


<p>
    First you'll need a server obviously. For the sake of simplicity this guide will be described using a Raspberry Pi 2, as
    it offers a GPIO port which does the job without complex circuits. However you can try to setup the server on other platforms
    as well. Hardware IR transmitter (LED). Note the electric current of the LED I
    <sub>f</sub> in
    <i>A</i>. This is needed to calculate a proper R. Resistor for avoiding to fry the IR-LED. Apply the formula R =
    <sup>U</sup>/
    <sub>I</sub> to calculate it. Some cables to connect it to the GPIO. If you use a standard PC you should use a Serial IR transmitter
    circuit.

    This may vary and can be modified to personal preference. In this section i'll be covering the setup for the Raspberry Pi
    Software A Linux based operating system. I've been using OSMC, as i use the Raspberry Pi mostly with this OS attached
    to my TV. So it's also at the perfect position to send IR.

    Start the server
</p>

<p>
    After fulfilling the requiremets you can download the server script and start it. Please make sure to modify the listed variables
    to match your hardware. Variables The GPIO Port where the IR-LED is connected to. I'll be using GPIO 17. Make sure you're
    using a 3.3V Pin! Modify this line accordingly:
</p>

<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <samp>tx = GPIOIRTransmission(pi, 17, query_carrier[0])</samp>
</div>

<p>
    The network interface and port. Basically, just make sure your server is not accessible from outside your local LAN. And
    setup firewall properly if you don't want others to change your TV channels ;-). Adapt to your IP and Port:
</p>


<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <samp>server = HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 8080), GetHandler)</samp>
</div>

<p>
    <a href="scripts/irpluslan.py" target="_blank">Download the Python Server script</a>
</p>

<p>
    Start the server by calling:
</p>

<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <samp>nohup python irplus.py & </samp>
</div>

<p>
    If you want to kill it call this in your browser or any program:
</p>

<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <samp>http://192.168.1.104:8080?command=kill</samp>
</div>

    Specification of request
</p>

<p>
    Specification of request The requests for IR-signals are made up like this and can be sent from other applications or the
    web-browser as well if you have the raw IR code.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    <samp>http://192.168.1.104:8080/?carrier=38000&code=9000+4500...</samp>
</div>

<p class="lead">
    Room for improvement
</p>

<p>
    Find a way to send modulated IR signals without using a native C library. Probably will be hard... Update the server code
    to Python3 Provide alternative means to process the requests. E.g. Nodejs, Java etc.
